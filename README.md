Just starting Tic-Tac-Toe project, enjoy!
1. Create a module for the gameboard. Gameboard should be an array inside of a gameboard object
2. Players will be created with a factory function because there are multiple being created
 - Try having as little global code as possible, tuck everything inside a module or factory
 - 3 main objects. Gameboard, Player, and game.
 -Gameboard is the displayed grid for tic tac toe
 -Player is each player.
 -Game provides game rules and restrictions and applies them.
